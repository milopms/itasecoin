Itasecoin is a cryptocurrency originally created for high school and college students in France. It is a very lite version of Litecoin, using the Scrypt hashing method as a proof-of-work algorithm. <br>The Itasecore software allows anyone in the whole world to operate a node in the Itasecoin blockchain networks. It is adapted from Litecoin Core and other cryptocurrencies.
 - 2 minute block targets

 - 60 coins per block
 - 2016 blocks to retarget difficulty

## Usage

To get started with Itasecore, see the [installation guide](INSTALL.md) and the [getting started](doc/getting-started.md) tutorial.

The JSON-RPC API provided by Itasecore is self-documenting and can be browsed with `itasecore-cli help`, while detailed information for each command can be viewed with `itasecore-cli help <command>`. 
<br>Alternatively, see the [Bitcoin Core documentation](https://developer.bitcoin.org/reference/rpc/) - which implement a similar protocol - to get a browsable version.

### Ports

Itasecore by default uses port `25075` for peer-to-peer communication that
is needed to synchronize the "mainnet" blockchain and stay informed of new
transactions and blocks. Additionally, a JSONRPC port can be opened, which
defaults to port `29045` for mainnet nodes. It is strongly recommended to not
expose RPC ports to the public internet.

| Function | mainnet | testnet | regtest |
| :------- | ------: | ------: | ------: |
| P2P      |   25075 |   19107 |   13107 |
| RPC      |   29045 |   12038 |   29074 |
